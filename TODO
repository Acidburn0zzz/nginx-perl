	Thing to do before release:

	- proper LICENSE and COPYRIGHT information;

	- implement dedicated timer for ngx_perl_resolver,
	  just like upstream does;

	- proper tests, probably reuse some code from Maxim's test suite 
	  Test::Nginx ( http://mdounin.ru/hg/nginx-tests/ );

	- find a way to make and release separate testable modules
	  on cpan, with meta module like Nginx::Perl to depend on
	  or something;

	- merge with latest nginx release;
