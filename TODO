	Things to do before release:

	- proper LICENSE and COPYRIGHT information;

	- bugfix: implement dedicated timer for ngx_perl_resolver,
	  just like upstream does;

	- proper tests, probably reuse some code from Maxim's test suite 
	  Test::Nginx ( http://mdounin.ru/hg/nginx-tests/ );

	- find a way to make and release separate testable modules
	  on cpan, with meta module like Nginx::Perl to depend on
	  or something;

	- merge with latest nginx release;

	- project page, probably at http://zzzcpan.github.com/nginx-perl/ ;







	Someday or never, just some ideas to consider:

	- perl_server block for arbitrary tcp servers, not just http:

	  perl_server {
	      listen  55555;
	      perl_accept  My::accept_handler;
	  }

	- perl_app as psgi, everything is already there, should
	  be trivial to implement.

	    https://github.com/miyagawa/psgi-specs
	      docs;

	    https://github.com/yappo/nginx-psgi-patchs  
	      doesn't handle request body properly, but nice example
	      on what psgi wants from the subroutine;

	    https://github.com/yko/ngx_mod_psgi
	      example on test suite, figure out how to actually run it;
