	Things to do before release:

	- bugfix: implement dedicated timer for ngx_perl_resolver,
	  just like upstream does;

	- proper tests, probably reuse some code from Maxim's test suite 
	  Test::Nginx ( http://mdounin.ru/hg/nginx-tests/ );

	- find a way to make and release separate testable modules
	  on cpan, with meta module like Nginx::Perl to depend on
	  or something;

	- merge with latest nginx release;







	Someday or never, just some ideas to consider:

	- perl_server block for arbitrary tcp servers, not just http:

	  perl_server {
	      listen  55555;
	      perl_accept  My::accept_handler;
	  }
