NAME
    nginx-perl - full featured perl support for nginx

URL
    <http://zzzcpan.github.com/nginx-perl/>

DESCRIPTION
    nginx-perl is a high-performance asynchronous perl web server. It is
    designed to provide some level of access to nginx's event loop from
    embedded perl. And not just some, but with simplicity in mind.

  FASTER THAN NODE.JS
    Asynchronous API is designed to be both simple and fast. Even though
    simplicity was the goal, nginx-perl can easily beat node.js in
    performance. To verify there is a simple redis-based application for
    both node.js and nginx-perl.

  FIRST-CLASS HTTP SERVER
    It's nginx. Nothing can compete with this.

    And it's not just about HTTP protocol, it is also out of the box process
    management, logging, security and lots of various 3rd party modules
    available for nginx.

  SMP OUT OF THE BOX
    Nginx allows you to start as many workers as you need. Easy to scale.

  SIMPLE BUT POWERFUL
    nginx-perl does actual reading and writing but leaves flow control
    completely up to us. So we can focus on the thing that we want to do
    rather than dealing with syscalls.

    Here is an example of low-level asynchronous HTTP request:

        ngx_connector '1.2.3.4', 80, 15, sub {
            return NGX_CLOSE                # close connection
                  if  $!;                   # on error
        
            my $c   = shift;
            my $buf = "GET /" . "\x0d\x0a";
        
            ngx_writer $c, $buf, 15, sub {
                return NGX_CLOSE            # close connection
                      if  $!;               # on error
            
                $buf = '';                  # clear buffer
            
                return NGX_READ;            # start reading response
            };
        
            ngx_reader $c, $buf, 0, 0, 15, sub {
                return NGX_CLOSE            # close connection
                      if  $!;               # on any error, incl. EOF
            
                warn "buf = '$buf'\n";
            
                $buf = '';                  # clear buffer 
            
                return NGX_READ;            # read again
            };        
        
            return NGX_WRITE;               # send request
        };
